Security Markdown
=================
With the introduction of Security as Code and DevSecOps practices, it is essential to collect security information about a workload within its code repository.  This practice has been in place for some time within progressive organizations looking to take advantage of a united workflow.

# Format for Security.md
We decided that we were not only going to require SECURITY.md within the root of our projects but that we would define a standard template for what we expect in the file.  It's essential that the information in the Security markdown file contain the necessary essentials for ensuring security defects get reported to the right people and resolved quickly.
